__Question 1:__ The code printed by line 9 is: "values added: 20".

&nbsp;

__Question 2:__ The code printed by line 13 is: "final result: 20".

&nbsp;

__Question 3:__ The code printed by line 9 is: "values added: 20".

&nbsp;

__Question 4:__ The code returns an error for line 13 becuase the variable "result" was declared using the "let" keyword which makes the variable accessible only within the block it is defined, and the code in line 13 is outside the if/else block which "result" was declared in.

&nbsp;

__Question 5:__ The code returns an error for line 7 because we declared the "result" variable using the "const" keyword, and we later tried to change its value. So nothing is produced by line 9.

__Question 6:__ Similar to Question 5, the code returns an error for line 7 because we declared the "result" variable using the "const" keyword, and we later tried to change its value. So nothing is produced by line 13.
